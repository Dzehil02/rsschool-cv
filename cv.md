let tmp = '';

for (let i=1000; i<=3000; i++) {
   tmp = tmp +'&#'+i+' ';
}
out.innerHTML = tmp;
```

```
let out = document.getElementById('out');
let tmp = '';

for (let i=1; i<=100; i++) {
   tmp = tmp + i + ' ';
}
out.innerHTML = tmp;
```

## My work experience

*Easy examples of work for yourself (JS, HTML, CSS)*

## My education
*I graduated from the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics with a degree in radioelectronics engineer. In the future, I plan to become a good web developer! To do this, I watch video tutorials (YouTube), webinars (GeekBrains) and go through training in the RS School.*

## My english
*I read the documentation in English (often with a translator). I try to read adapted books (for children) in English every evening.
I plan to devote more time to learning English.*
